<p>Digital sticky notes for the distracted hacker!</p>

<p>Currently in the most barebones state, rushed to ship it for the free tshirt lol. I am however hooked on this, and am motivated to continue developing!</p>

<p>In the future I hope for it to be seamless, but currently to create a new note you have to focus on (click) the "tk" window and press CTRL+N. You'll be prompted for a starting text, and then the note will be made. You can drag the box anywhere on your screen, and click inside to add more text.</p>

<p>There's a todo list in the photo attached, but in short I want a neat seamless customisable way to store text, pictures or drawings on your screen without them getting lost.</p>
